# Route Planning based on Traffic Noise using Genetic and A* Algorithm 

This project aims to use the Genetic and A* Algorithms to perform efficient path planning based on traffic noise on the IISER Bhopal Campus.

The two algorithms are implemented in separate '.py' files and can be executed through the terminal.

The dataset is loaded, pre-processed and used to perform route planning within these files itself, along with audio manipulation.
