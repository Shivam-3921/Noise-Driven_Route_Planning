# Route Planning based on Traffic Noise using Genetic and A* Algorithm 

This project aims to use the Genetic and A* Algorithms to perform efficient path planning based on traffic noise on the IISER Bhopal Campus.

The two algorithms are implemented in separate '.ipynb' files and can be executed through the terminal. These notebooks are contained in the 'codes' folder. The 'dataset' folder consists of audio files and csv files describing coordinates of nodes and distances between them. The project report is included in the 'report' folder.
